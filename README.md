# HTML-PRACTICE
This repository contains my practice work with HTML tags as I learn and explore the basics of web development. The purpose of this project is to get hands-on experience with various HTML elements and understand their structure and usage.

✅ Topics Covered:
Basic structure of an HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)

Text formatting tags (<h1>–<h6>, <p>, <strong>, <em>, <br>, <hr>)

Links and images (<a>, <img>)

Lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>)

Tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>, <th>)

Forms (<form>, <input>, <textarea>, <button>, <label>, <select>)

Semantic elements (<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>)

Media tags (<audio>, <video>, <iframe>)
